<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Tyler Claypool. This product is very special to me. I was born too early in the country of Guatemala. I was adopted at 6 months of age. At 18 months I was diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy. I was never able to crawl and did learn to walk until I was 4. I have had numerous surgeries. My last surgery involved a bone graft to my left foot. After the graft, my left quit growing while my right kept growing. I remember the first time my mother offered to buy me two different pairs of shoes. After years of a size 6.5 on my left foot and a 9 on my right, I have boxes of mismatched shoes that someone must need.</p>
